# Tachyphylaxis

This project is an interactive device geared towards learning through memorization. There are a total of two modes the user can choose from.

## How to Use

This should include how to actually use your project. Is there a process you need to use to build it? How is it deployed. After reading this section I should be able to download this file and have easy steps to follow to get the project to run.

## How it Works

The main tool we used for most of the features of this interactive learning device, turtle, enabled us to make the game interactive in the first place. Turtle's click detection feature allows the device to respond to the user's input and react accordingly. The first mode, multiple choice, asks a question and gives 4 possible answers. If the user gets the answer correct, they are awarded one point. If he or she gets the answer wrong, the device displays the correct answer and the user does not get a point. After 5 questions, the user is told how many total they got correct. The second mode, free drawing, allows the user to practice drawing diagams or pictures to assist with memorization. This can be done however many times as the amount of inputs they submit prior to beginning.

### Technology

The main tools that were used to make this project are Python and Python's built in module called turtle.

### File Structure

The files used in this device are the main Python file and a text file used for storing the questions and answers for the first mode, multiple choice.

### Problems

Some major problems our group faced and overcame were communication problems, simultaneously incorporating everyone into the project, making sure no one was idling. Additionally, our group found it difficult and time consuming to combine all of the group member's code at the end of the project due to syntax, repitition, inconsistensy in variables, and miscommunication of parts.

### Issues

In the drawing mode, the mechanism is not smooth, not allowing you to draw fast without becoming dots instead of a smooth line. It is also slightly inconvenient in that it sometimes requires the user to double-click. Additionally, the multiple choice mode does not yet take user inputs as we did not have enough time to impliment this.
### Future Improvements

One of the main things we would like to improve in the future is the general looks of the Interactive Learning Device. We would make both modes more aesthetically pleasing and smooth if we had an unlimited amount of time. Additionally, we were not able to fully complete our third mode, card matching. We would add this as an option for the user.
